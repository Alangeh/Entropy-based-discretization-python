# Entropy-based-discretization-python
Perform entropy based discretization calculating values for entropy and best information gain over a given dataset
Dataset consist of 3 answers of user between ages 8 and 95
These answers are either yes (E) or no (H) giving a total of 8 combinations (2^3)
Taking variable split ages between ages 9 and 95 the code calculates the information split and gain for all 8 iterations
And displays the best split age with its corresponding info gain I(G)
